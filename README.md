# StructuralAdvice

I started this project at 2002, never finished.

I just put the source codes, and the project doesn't run.

GUI : Tkinter, wxPython
Matrix process : NumPy ?   

It is consisted of processes as follows.

.. Preprocess : Geometry, gravity load (dead/live) input
.. Analysis : Simple matrix process
.. Postprocess : Section design, H beam selection, Bending Moment Diagram, Sheer Force Diagram

You can use it freely.
